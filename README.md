# 2D Collision Library


## Description
The core idea of the project was to build a physics engine to simulate object in space, based on collision detection and collision resolution patterns.
1) A polygon collision detection system
2) A circle collision detection and resolution system

## Instructions
- Run the CollisionLibraryDemo.py file using a Python compiler
- To access the two different modes, use number keys 1 and 2
- To add polygons/circles press 'A'
- To display the quad tree division, press 'D'
- To reset the simulation, press 'R'
Note : Make sure Pygame is installed
